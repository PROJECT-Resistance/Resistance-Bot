# PROJECT: Resistance Bot

The Resistance Bot is a small Discord bot made using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). It is designed to automate some specific administrative actions, as well as provide fun and entertaining features for the group.

## Important!
This project has 2 seperate branches. If you want to download and use the code for yourself, use the link to the public releases page below. You could download the master branch manually, but I would not recommend that.  

A list of stable releases can be found [here.](https://lordvertice.hopto.org/LordVertice/resistance-bot/-/releases) (public-version only)

You are currently viewing the "public-version" branch.


## Installation

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).  
Then download the latest version of this project from the [releases page](https://lordvertice.hopto.org/LordVertice/resistance-bot/-/releases).  
Now you have to download [this](https://mega.nz/file/qB9ECKrL#2tInDeIXNWZZ9m2jJrfM9rSjnCdnxp8Vm5XAmEnxvyc) template, put it in the root folder of the source code (next to the main.js file) and paste your API token inside, replacing \<token here>.

## Usage

After installing, you want to enter the following commands: (new line = new command)

```bash
cd <path>
node .
```
You should replace \<path> with the location of your download (the folder with main.js and token.json).  
The bot should start up now. If you want to shut it down, press ctrl+c.

Alternatively, you can enable the bot's logging feature by starting it with this command:
```bash
cd <path>
node . >>log.txt
```
Please note that the bot will only log messages that start with it's current prefix. Logs will be saved in \<path>/log.txt

## Contributing

In order to create a merge request, you might need to fork the project first.
