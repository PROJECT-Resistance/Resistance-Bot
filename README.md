This is Resistance-chan, also known as Resi. She's a Discord bot built with Node.js and the discord.js library. Resi provides a handful of fun and helpful commands for the "PROJECT: Resistance" Discord server, and she can be expanded easily with modular commands.

Features:
* Modular command and event loading for easy modification
* Persistent per-server settings
* Can be self hosted (tutorial will be added to the wiki)

If you have any questions, ideas for new features, any problems you need help solving, or even some improvements, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/PROJECT-Resistance/Resistance-Bot/issues).

Special thanks to Mk_TheOnePixel for providing artwork and assets. :smile:

Resi was made using the following projects:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
