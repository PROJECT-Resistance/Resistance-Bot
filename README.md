# PROJECT: Resistance Bot

The Resistance Bot is a small Discord bot made using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). It is designed to automate some specific administrative actions, as well as provide fun and entertaining features for the group.

## Important!
This is the unfinished version of Resi 2.0, a full rewrite of the original bot. DO NOT use this in production.
